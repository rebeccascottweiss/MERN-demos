  Given two arrays of ints
  return the symmetric differences, (aka disjunctive union)

      think of a venn diagram filled in except the overlapping middle part is not filled in (the intersection is excluded)
    - i.e., if an element is in at least one of the arrays, but not in any other, it should be included (dupes included 1 time only)
